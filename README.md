## Installation

Use Python3

    pip3 install virtualenv 
    [use pip instead of pip3 if it doesn't work]
    
    python -m venv env
    [create a virtual environment for dependencies. dont skip this]

    .\env\Scripts\activate [Windows]
    source env/bin/activate [MacOS]
    if it doesn't work, follow this [guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
    [use pip instead of pip3 if it doesn't work]
    
    python3 pre_requisites.py 
    [use python instead of python3 if it doesn't work]

Test run

    python3 main.py --type fixed "src/data/test/Agnes-Kim.pdf" --model_name model 
    [use python instead of python3 if it doesn't work]


## Usage
### For testing:
Test resumes can be found in `src/data/test`

#### Supervised (Fixed Keywords)
For the fixed keyword implementation, the pre-trained model is trained on the keywords:

`[fund, asset, investment, accounting, trust, strategy]`

To use it, type:

      python3 main.py path/to/resume

or, long-form,

      python3 main.py --type fixed path/to/resume


for specific model (no default):

      python3 main.py --type fixed path/to/resume --model_name model


or using model path (no default):

      python3 main.py --type fixed path/to/resume --model_path path/to/model


Resume should be `pdf` or `docx` format
Pre-trained model: `src/models/model_fixed/model.json`
Pre-trained model_name: `model`

#### Unsupervised (LDA-generated keywords)
To use the LDA-generated keyword implementation:

      python3 main.py --type lda path/to/resume

for specific model:

      python3 main.py --type lda path/to/resume --model_name model

or using model path (no default):

      python3 main.py --type lda path/to/resume --model_path path/to/model

Resume should be `pdf` or `docx` format
Pre-trained model: `src/models/model_lda/model.json`
Pre-trained model name: `model`

---
### For training:
Training resumes can be found in `src/data/train` (size=1468) [seems like the author removed these files]

or for a smaller dataset (size=30), `src/data/sample_train` [seems like the author removed these files]
#### Supervised (Fixed Keywords)
For the fixed keyword implementation:

      python3 main.py --train path/of/training_directory --type fixed --keywords fund asset investment accounting trust strategy --model_name abc_model

Model and keywords will be saved in `src/models/model_fixed`

#### Unsupervised (LDA-generated keywords)
For the LDA-generated keyword implementation:

      python3 main.py --train path/of/training_directory --type lda  --model_name abc_model

Model and LDA model will be saved in `src/models/model_lda`
